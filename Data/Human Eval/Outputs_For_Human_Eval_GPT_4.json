    "0": "'Make a remark' can mean comment, remark, state, say.\n'about' can be a wordplay indicator meaning surrounding or encircling.\n'note' can mean memo, message, or musical notes like do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti.\n'about' encircling 'note' suggests the structure of the answer might involve a word around a note.\n\nLet\u2019s consider musical notes for simplicity:\n- If \"note\" is a musical note, and we use 're' (a common choice in crosswords), we need a word where 're' is encircled by other letters to form a word meaning 'make a remark'.\n- \"Remark\" about 're' could be \"comment\" where 're' is inside. But it doesn't fit the character count.\n- Trying another approach with the word \"comment\" itself as the answer, where 'note' is represented by 'nt' (abbreviation for 'note'), and 'comment' encircles 'nt': co(nt)ment. However, this doesn't fit the character count and the structure doesn't work perfectly.\n\nLet's try another note:\n- Using 'do' (another common musical note in crosswords), we need a word where 'do' is part of the word meaning 'make a remark'.\n- \"Remark\" about 'do' could be \"commend\" where 'do' is inside: commen(do). This fits both the definition and the character count.\n\nAnswer: COMMEND",
    "1": "'versatile worker' can mean handyman, jack of all trades, generalist.\n'though' can mean but, yet.\n'he's not a master of a craft' could imply someone who is skilled but not an expert or master.\n'jack of all trades' fits as someone who is versatile and skilled in many areas but not necessarily a master in any.\n'jack of all trades' is 15 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: JACK OF ALL TRADES",
    "2": "'ascent' can mean climb, rise, or scale.\n'without' is likely a wordplay indicator meaning to exclude something.\n'as much as one percent' suggests taking a small part or a fraction.\n'decimal currency' might refer to cents or a specific part of a currency that uses decimals like cents in dollars.\n\nLet's try to break down 'one percent of decimal currency':\n- 'one percent' can be represented as 0.01.\n- If we consider 'decimal currency' as cents, then 'one percent of cents' could be interpreted as 0.01 cents.\n\nIf we take 'ascent' as 'rise' and remove 'i' (representing 'one percent' as i, the first letter of 'decimal'):\n- We get 'rse'.\n\nHowever, this doesn't form a meaningful word. Let's consider:\n- 'ascent' as 'rise' and remove 'c' (considering 'c' for 'cents' as a part of 'decimal currency'):\n- You get 'rise' without 'c' which is 'rise'.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the clue's requirement of a 4-letter word. Let's reconsider:\n- If we take 'climb' and remove 'c' (from 'cents'):\n- We get 'limb'.\n\nLimb fits the clue's requirement of a 4-letter word and the wordplay:\n- 'climb' meaning ascent.\n- Removing 'c' (representing cents as a part of decimal currency).\n\nAnswer: LIMB",
    "3": "'Take paces' can imply walking or stepping.\n'from past' can mean ago.\n'if' can be a conjunction or simply the letters IF.\n'fences' can mean encloses, surrounds, or barriers.\n'become rigid' might imply stiffen or harden.\n\nLet's analyze the phrase structure:\n- \"Take paces from past if fences become rigid\" suggests a transformation or condition.\n- \"Take paces from past\" might imply a historical or previous context.\n- \"if fences become rigid\" suggests a conditional change in the fences.\n\nNow, let's try to find a word that fits:\n- Considering the clue structure, we can think of a transformation involving the word 'fences'.\n- 'Fences' could metaphorically mean boundaries or limits.\n- 'Become rigid' suggests these boundaries or limits becoming fixed or inflexible.\n\nThinking of synonyms for 'fences' and 'rigid':\n- Fences can be thought of as 'hedges'.\n- Rigid can mean stiff or strict.\n\nPutting it together:\n- 'Fences become rigid' could mean 'hedges' becoming 'stiff'.\n- However, we need a word that fits the structure of the clue and the length (7 letters).\n\nLet's consider:\n- The transformation of 'fences' (hedges) to a state of being rigid or stiff.\n- The word 'hedges' itself can be transformed by adding a condition 'if', but we need to consider the entire clue.\n\nFinal thought:\n- 'Stiffen', meaning to become rigid, doesn't fit directly but it's close.\n- We need a word that incorporates the idea of boundaries (fences) and becoming rigid.\n\nAnswer: STIFFEN (as in 'if' included within 'stiffen', indicating a change or condition applied to 'fences').",
    "4": "'Moving very slowly' can mean creeping, inching, crawling.\n'thatching' could be a reference to a roof or cover, or it might be used more metaphorically.\n'without that inside' suggests removing the word \"that\" from another word or phrase.\nWe need to think of a word related to 'thatching' that can include 'that' which can be removed.\n\nLet's consider 'thatching' and see if it can be rearranged or modified:\nIf we consider 'thatching' and remove 'that', we get 'ching'.\nNow, we need to see if 'ching' relates to 'moving very slowly'. This doesn\u2019t seem to fit.\n\nPerhaps we need to reconsider the interpretation:\nIf we think of 'thatching' more metaphorically or abstractly, we might consider words like 'cover', 'roof', or similar terms.\nBut we need a 7-letter word. Let\u2019s think about synonyms for 'moving very slowly' that fit:\n- inching (fits the length and the clue of moving very slowly)\n\nLet\u2019s see if 'inching' can be broken down into a wordplay involving 'thatching' and 'without that inside':\nIf we consider 'inching', it doesn\u2019t directly relate to 'thatching', but it may not need to if 'thatching' is just a container or misleading context.\n\nTherefore, 'inching' might be the best fit:\n- It fits the definition of 'moving very slowly'.\n- It is 7 letters, matching the requirement.\n- The clue's construction might be more about misleading through the word 'thatching', focusing on the movement aspect.\n\nAnswer: INCHING",
    "5": "'Am up from the bottom' suggests a reversal or backward reading of the word 'am' which is 'ma'.\n'to see' might be a linking phrase or could suggest looking or viewing, but often it's used to connect parts of the clue.\n'a mountain lion' is commonly known as a 'puma'.\nif we reverse 'ma' and add 'puma', we get 'mapuma' which doesn't make sense.\nHowever, if we consider 'puma' alone, which fits the definition of 'mountain lion' and also fits the character count of 4.\nAnswer: PUMA",
    "6": "'spell' can mean to articulate or arrange letters.\n'tact coming' rearranged can be an anagram, as 'in a different way' suggests rearrangement.\nThe phrase 'to philatelic hobby' is likely the definition part of the clue.\nPhilatelic hobby refers to stamp collecting.\nWe need to find a 15-letter word related to stamp collecting.\nRearranging 'tact coming' does not directly fit with stamp collecting, so we need to consider the entire phrase 'tact coming in a different way.'\nAn anagram of 'tact coming' alone doesn't reach 15 letters, so let's consider including 'in a different way' as part of the anagram fodder or as instruction for further modification.\nHowever, rechecking the anagram of 'tact coming' alone, we find it can be rearranged to 'stamp collecting', which fits perfectly with the definition and is 15 letters.\nAnswer: STAMP COLLECTING",
    "7": "'What a day might seem like' suggests describing the length or experience of a day.\n'for a dog who's lost his tail' suggests a wordplay involving a dog-related word losing its last letter ('tail').\n'interminable' suggests something that is endless or very long.\n\nLet's consider dog-related words and see if removing the last letter gives a word that means 'interminable':\n- \"endless\" doesn't fit as it doesn't relate to a dog term.\n- \"forever\" doesn't fit for the same reason.\n- \"eternal\" also doesn't fit.\n\nHowever, if we consider \"day\" as a potential word to modify, and think of the phrase \"a dog's age\" which means a very long time:\n- \"A dog's age\" loses its 'tail' or last letter, becoming \"a dog's ag\" which doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's look at simpler terms:\n- A common phrase is \"a day can feel like 'forever' to a dog\", but again, removing the tail from 'forever' doesn't work.\n\nConsidering the word \"endless\":\n- If we think of a dog-related word that could mean 'endless' when its tail is lost, \"endless\" itself doesn't fit as it isn't derived from a dog-related term.\n\nLet's revisit simpler terms:\n- \"Daylong\" is a term to describe something lasting for a day. If we remove the tail (last letter 'g'), we get \"daylon\" which doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAfter rethinking:\n- The word \"endless\" itself, while not directly derived from a dog-related term, could metaphorically describe a day from a dog's perspective as feeling very long, especially if the dog is waiting or bored. However, no tail is lost here.\n\nWe need to reconsider the interpretation:\n- \"Endless\" might not need a modification if the clue is metaphorical rather than direct wordplay. The idea could be that a day feels \"endless\" to a dog, especially if it's waiting or missing something (like its tail).\n\nSo, the answer is likely:\nAnswer: ENDLESS",
    "8": "'Point out' can mean indicate, show, mark.\n'a piebald horse' can mean a horse with irregular patches of two colors, typically black and white.\nA common term for a piebald horse is 'pinto'.\n'Point out' can also be a wordplay indicator, suggesting a synonym or description.\n'pinto' is a type of piebald horse.\npinto is 5 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: PINTO",
    "9": "'Fold' can mean crease, bend, pleat.\n'broken' is often used as an indicator for anagrams in cryptic crosswords.\n'plate' can be rearranged to form 'pleat'.\n'pleat' is a synonym for 'fold'.\n'pleat' fits the character count of 5.\nAnswer: PLEAT",
    "10": "'mixed-up' is likely an anagram indicator in this context.\n'cubit' is the word to be mixed up.\nAn anagram of \"cubit\" along with an additional letter or letters might form a word.\n\nWe need to find a synonym for 'cookie' that fits the pattern.\nA popular cookie is a 'biscuit'.\nIf we check the letters in 'cubit' and see if they can be rearranged to form 'biscuit', we find that we're missing an 's' and an 'i'.\n\nAnagramming 'cubit' with 'is' (since 'is' could be the additional letters needed):\nC U B I T + I S can be rearranged to form BISCUIT.\n\n'biscuit' is a synonym for 'cookie' and it fits the character count of 7.\nAnswer: BISCUIT",
    "11": "'Grip' can mean hold, clutch, grasp, or handle.\n'Ostensibly' suggests something apparent or seeming, possibly indicating the surface reading or outer letters.\n'Holding' is often a container indicator in cryptic clues, meaning that one part of the clue should be inside another.\n'A rejoinder' is a response or a reply, which could be synonyms like retort or comeback.\n\nSince 'ostensibly' might hint at taking the outer letters, let's consider 'grip' and 'ostensibly' for outer letters:\n- The outer letters of 'grip' are G and P.\n- If we look at 'holding a rejoinder' and consider 'a rejoinder' as 'retort', then placing 'a' inside 'retort' doesn't seem to fit directly, but let's focus on the structure.\n\nConsidering 'holding' as a container indicator, we need a word that can encapsulate 'a' inside a synonym for 'rejoinder':\n- 'Retort' can be broken down to 're' + 'tort', where 'tort' is a legal term but doesn't directly fit with 'a'.\n\nLet's look at another possible synonym for 'rejoinder':\n- 'Comeback' is another synonym, but too long.\n- 'Answer' is another synonym but doesn't fit the structure.\n- 'Retort' seems the most likely, but we need to fit 'a' inside it somehow.\n\nIf we consider 'grip' as 'handle' and use the structure:\n- 'Handle' could be seen as 'h' + 'andle', but this still doesn't fit perfectly.\n\nLet's reevaluate:\n- 'Grip' as 'handle', and think about 'ostensibly' indicating the appearance or outer part.\n- Placing 'a' within 'retort' still seems like the best option, but how it fits with 'handle' isn't clear.\n\nRevisiting the clue structure:\n- 'Grip ostensibly holding a rejoinder' suggests a synonym for 'grip' holding a letter 'a' and a synonym for 'rejoinder'.\n- 'Handle' as a synonym for 'grip' and 'retort' for 'rejoinder'.\n- If we consider 'handle' as 'hand' + 'le', and then insert 'a' into 'retort', it still doesn't fit.\n\nFinal rethink:\n- 'Handle' might be the answer if we consider 'grip' and 'ostensibly' indicating the appearance or method of holding, but 'retort' as the rejoinder doesn't seem to encapsulate 'a' correctly.\n\nReconsidering the interpretation of 'retort' and how 'a' fits:\n- If 'retort' is broken down to 're' + 'tort', and we somehow fit 'a' in an extended sense, it might not be straightforward.\n\nGiven the complexity and potential misinterpretation of the clue structure, the best answer seems to be 'HANDLE', interpreting 'grip' directly and considering the structure more loosely with 'ostensibly' and 'holding' as general indicators of form and containment rather than specific letter insertion.\n\nAnswer: HANDLE",
    "12": "'At last' is likely a wordplay indicator suggesting the use of the last letter of a word.\n'am' from the clue can be used directly.\n'in' is probably a wordplay indicator for inclusion.\n'a position of lasting strength' can mean a stronghold, fortress, or bastion.\nConsidering the word 'bastion' which means a position of strength or defense.\n'At last' am would be m.\nSo, putting m in bastion would not work directly, but we can consider the structure.\nThe answer could be a word that includes 'm' and represents a position of lasting strength.\n'bastion' fits the definition and the letter count of 7.\nAnswer: BASTION",
    "13": "'some consideration' can mean a bit, part, thought.\n'wild' can mean crazy, untamed, chaotic, anagram indicator.\n'hot thug' can mean a dangerous person, but it might be used as an anagram fodder.\nUsing 'wild' as an anagram indicator, rearranging the letters of 'hot thug' gives 'thought'.\n'thought' can mean 'some consideration'.\n'thought' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: THOUGHT",
    "14": "'Initially' is often used in cryptic crosswords to indicate taking the initial letters of the following words.\n'any region extending around land' gives us the words Any, Region, Extending, and Land.\nTaking the initial letters of each word, we get A, R, E, and A.\nPutting these letters together forms the word AREA.\n'Area' is a synonym for 'region' and fits the clue both in definition and letter count.\nAREA is 4 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: AREA",
    "15": "'Just' can mean fair, mere, only.\n'church' can mean CE (Church of England), RC (Roman Catholic).\n'fete' can mean fair, gala, celebration.\n'Just a church fete' might be simplifying the phrase to focus on one element.\n'Just a church fete' could be hinting at a simple or straightforward term.\n'fair' can mean both 'just' in the sense of equitable and 'fete' as in a type of gathering.\n'fair' is 4 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: FAIR",

    "30": "'test' can mean try, exam, probe.\n'the irate characters' suggests focusing on the letters in \"irate\".\n'deprived of their will' could mean removing specific letters, potentially the letter 'I' (a homophone for 'will' in terms of personal volition).\nRemoving 'I' from 'irate' leaves 'rate'.\n'writer' could be the definition.\nA writer named with 'rate' in it is not directly clear, so let's consider another interpretation.\nPerhaps 'test the irate characters deprived of their will' means using the characters from 'irate' in a different way.\nRemoving 'I' from 'irate' and using the remaining 'rate' could be part of the wordplay.\nIf we consider 'writer' as a separate clue, we might look for a famous writer with 'rate' in their name.\nNathaniel Hawthorne doesn't fit as it's too long and doesn't contain 'rate'.\nLet's consider other famous writers or a rearrangement.\nReconsidering 'test' as 'trial' and combining it with 'rate' doesn't yield a known writer.\nSince the clue is complex, let's consider if there's an anagram or hidden word involving 'irate' minus 'I'.\n'rate' doesn't suggest a specific writer, but if we consider synonyms for 'test' like 'trial', 'exam', 'probe', 'essay', and look for a 7-letter writer, we can try:\n'Essayist' fits as a generic term for a writer, particularly one who tests ideas.\nHowever, it's not a specific writer's name and doesn't fit perfectly with the 'rate' derived from 'irate'.\nLet's check for anagrams or hidden meanings in 'irate' or 'test'.\nA famous writer with a name that could be cryptically derived from these letters is not immediately clear.\nLet's consider 'tester' as a possibility, referencing someone who tests, but it doesn't fit perfectly.\nThe clue remains challenging without more context or a clearer path to connect 'irate' and 'writer'. We might need to rethink the approach or get additional hints to solve this clue accurately.",
    "31": "'Okay' can suggest approval, fine, alright.\n'Pacino' refers to the actor Al Pacino.\n'is a conservative' can mean a member of a conservative party or ideology, often abbreviated as 'con' in British English.\nCombining 'Okay' as a synonym for 'fine' with 'Pacino' might suggest a wordplay or a hidden word.\n'Fine' followed by 'Pacino' could suggest using the actor's name in a playful or abbreviated manner.\nIf we consider the conservative abbreviation 'con', and merge it with 'Pacino' creatively, we get 'Pacino' with 'con' added, which could be 'Pacinocon'.\nHowever, this doesn't seem to fit well. Let\u2019s look at it differently.\n'Okay' can also mean 'alright', which is similar to 'all right'.\nIf we consider 'Al' from 'all' and 'Pacino', combining these with 'right' as a synonym for conservative (right-wing), we get 'Al Pacino' + 'right'.\nThis results in 'Al Pacino' being a conservative, which can be indicated by the term 'Al right'.\n'Alright' is commonly used and fits the character count of 7.\nAnswer: ALRIGHT",
    "32": "'Fur' can mean pelt, coat, hide.\n'stayed' can mean remained, lingered.\n'in audition' indicates a homophone clue (sounds like).\n'for medical help' can mean aid, care, assistance.\n\nCombining these:\n- 'Fur stayed in audition' suggests a homophone of a phrase where 'fur' and 'stayed' combine to sound like another word.\n- 'Fur' as 'fur' and 'stayed' sounds like 'aid' (homophone of stayed).\n- Putting them together doesn't form a clear word, so reconsidering 'fur' might lead to another homophone, such as 'first aid' (fur sounded + stayed sounding like first aid).\n\n'First aid' fits as a term for 'medical help'.\n'First aid' is 8 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: FIRST AID",
    "33": "'Gets drowsy' can mean nods off, sleepy, tired.\n'inside' is probably a wordplay indicator referring to containment.\n'Takes back' could mean to reverse or invert something.\n'fencing equipment' can mean epee, foil, saber.\n\nLet's explore the phrase 'Takes back fencing equipment':\n- If we take 'epee' and reverse it, it remains 'epee'.\n- If we take 'foil' and reverse it, it remains 'lifo'.\n- If we take 'saber' and reverse it, it becomes 'rebas'.\n\nNow, let's consider 'Gets drowsy inside':\n- We need a word that means 'gets drowsy' which can contain the reversed word for 'fencing equipment'.\n\nFrom the options:\n- 'Nods' or 'sleepy' can be considered for 'gets drowsy'.\n- If we place 'epee' inside 'nods', it doesn't fit.\n- If we place 'lifo' inside 'sleepy', it could be 's(lifo)epy', but that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n- If we place 'rebas' inside 'nods', it could be 'nod(rebas)', but that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nLet's reanalyze:\n- The clue says 'inside', so a word should contain another.\n- 'Takes back' suggests a reversal of the word for 'fencing equipment'.\n- The answer should be related to a state of being drowsy and must incorporate reversed fencing equipment.\n\nConsidering all aspects:\n- The word 'nod' (a shorter form of 'nods') meaning 'gets drowsy' fits.\n- 'saber' reversed is 'rebas'.\n- Putting 'rebas' inside 'nod' gives us 'nod(rebas)'.\n\nHowever, this still doesn't fit perfectly with the character count and the meaning.\n\nLet's reevaluate:\n- Another possibility for 'fencing equipment' is 'sabre'.\n- Reversing 'sabre' gives 'erbas'.\n- Placing 'erbas' inside a word related to 'gets drowsy' could work.\n\nThe correct answer:\n- 'dozes' means 'gets drowsy'.\n- 'sabre' reversed is 'erbas'.\n- 'dozes' containing 'sabre' reversed can be 'dozer' which is 'doze' with 'r' from 'sabre'.\n- This brings us to 'DOZERS' (6 letters), fitting the clue and character count.\n\nAnswer: DOZERS",

Let's think of another possible word.\nConsidering the word \"vixen\" again, if we remove the letters 'xen', we're left with 'vi', but that doesn't help.\nThis clue is tricky and might need a different approach or a reconsideration of the wordplay involved. Let's reanalyze:\nMaybe 'enter without oxen' means to find a word meaning 'enter' and then remove an anagram of 'oxen' from it.\nIf we take \"input\" as 'enter' and remove 'n', 'u', and 'p' (an anagram of 'pun' which could be derived from 'oxen'), it doesn\u2019t work.\nLet's consider simple synonyms of 'enter' like 'input', 'insert', 'admit'.\nIf we take \"admit\" and remove 'a', 'd', 'm', 'i', 't' sequentially considering any anagram of 'oxen', it doesn't fit.\nWe might be missing an easier solution or a direct wordplay. Let's think of a direct synonym for 'in pursuit of' or 'chasing', which could be 'after'.\nIf we take \"after\" and consider 'enter without oxen', it doesn't directly fit but let's consider 'after' as the answer:\n- 'A fox' could metaphorically mean being cunning or sly, often referred to as 'sly as a fox'.\n- 'In pursuit of a fox' could simply mean 'after'.\n- The phrase 'enter without oxen' could be a way to mislead by focusing on a complex removal which isn\u2019t necessary.\n'After' fits the character count of 5 and aligns with the simpler interpretation of being 'in pursuit of'.\nAnswer: AFTER",

We need to simplify.\n- Consider the basic units related to time, such as 'sec' (second). Placing 'n' before 'sec' would still be too long.\n- Simplify further by using a common abbreviation for 'second' which is 's'.\n- Placing 'n' before 's' gives 'ns', but we need three letters.\n- Considering a term like 'non' as in 'nonsec' (non-secular, not following the typical 'sec' or second).\n- However, 'non' itself means 'no' or 'not', which fits the clue of 'don't worry' as in 'no worries'.\n\nThe answer, considering the length and the cryptic nature of the clue, might be 'non', indicating not to worry unless it's a specific condition (before a timer). This fits the three-letter requirement.\n\nAnswer: NON",
    "44": "'Twitch' can mean jerk, spasm, tic.\n'initial' is probably a wordplay indicator referring to the first letters.\n'capitals' suggests using the first letters of each word.\nTaking the initial letters of \"capitals\" gives us \"C\".\nHowever, considering the meaning of 'Twitch' and the length of the answer (3 letters), 'tic' seems more appropriate.\n'tic' is a synonym for 'twitch'.\n'tic' is 3 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: TIC",

However, considering synonyms and length, the correct answer could be \"PRECEDE\" if we think of it as \"PRE\" (before) + \"CEDE\" (yield, coming from ego or self-esteem yielding to others). But this is 7 letters.\n\nReevaluating, if we simplify to just consider \"ego\" leading or being earlier, we can think of \"PREGO\" as a playful or informal way to say \"before\" due to ego, but the character count is off.\n\nThe best fit for a 6-letter word considering the clue and synonyms would be \"BEFORE,\" which directly means \"be earlier\" and can be influenced by one's self-esteem (ego) driving their actions to be ahead or first.

    "60": "'Genie's master' refers to Aladdin.\n'helps to make' is likely a wordplay indicator suggesting that letters from 'salad dinner' are used.\nLooking at the phrase 'salad dinner' for a 7-letter word that can be associated with Aladdin:\nConsidering the characters from 'salad dinner', we can arrange them to find a relevant word.\n'lad' from salad and 'dinner' can be rearranged but focusing on 'lad' as it connects directly to Aladdin who is often referred to as a young man or lad.\nThe word 'lad' isn't enough, so we need to check for a longer word using more letters.\n'lad' + 'in' from dinner forms 'ladin' which is not a complete word.\nAdding 'n' from dinner gives us 'LADINNE' which still isn't correct.\nReconsidering 'lad' and looking for combinations with 'dinner', we find 'LAD' + 'DINER' which forms 'LADDINER'.\nHowever, 'LADDINER' isn't a proper word. Let's consider synonyms or related words.\n'Aladdin' is closely associated with the concept of 'LAD', and considering the relevance to the clue's context and wordplay, the answer could be a slight deviation or a playful take.\nUpon further analysis, 'ALADDIN' itself, though directly referring to the genie's master, might be the intended answer, especially if the clue is playing on the direct name rather than a cryptic interpretation.\nAnswer: ALADDIN (though not fitting perfectly with the 'helps to make salad dinner' unless considering it as a cryptic or indirect reference).",
    "61": "'Camouflaged' is likely a wordplay indicator suggesting an anagram or hidden word.\n'studs' can mean pins, nails, buttons.\n'birthday suits' refers to being naked, nudity.\nWe need to find a 7-letter word related to the clue.\nConsidering 'studs' in 'birthday suits', the word 'nudists' can be considered.\n'nudists' are essentially in their 'birthday suits'.\n'nudists' is 7 letters, fitting the character count.\nAnswer: NUDISTS",
    "62": "'relative' can mean kin, uncle, aunt, etc.\n'raucous' suggests a noisy or disorderly context, often indicating an anagram indicator.\n'incursion' suggests an invasion or attack.\nHere, 'relative involvement' suggests that a word for 'relative' is contained within another word.\nIf we consider 'incursion' as the main word and look for a synonym or related term that fits the pattern, we can think of 'inrush'.\n'Inrush' is a type of incursion and is 6 characters long, fitting the character count.\n'Inrush' also contains 'in', which is a possible abbreviation or short form for a relative (indicating involvement or inclusion).\n\nAnswer: INRUSH",
    "63": "'headless' is probably a wordplay indicator meaning to remove the first letter.\n'mascot' can mean talisman, emblem, or symbol.\n'seen at racecourse' might be a definition or part of the wordplay.\nConsidering 'mascot' and removing the first letter 'm' from 'mascot' gives 'ascot'.\nAscot is a famous racecourse.\n'ascot' fits the character count of 5.\nAnswer: ASCOT",
    "64": "'My turn to be banker?' could be a cryptic definition.\n'Perfect!' can mean ideal, exact, right, spot on.\n'banker' might suggest a riverbank or similar.\n'Perfect!' as an indicator could also mean a complete or flawless condition.\nIn the game Monopoly, the banker handles all the money and transactions, which might be a hint towards the wordplay.\nThe answer might be a homophone or a pun.\n\nPutting it together:\n'My turn' could be a play on words indicating a homophone or a pun.\nA common phrase that means perfect could be \"ideal.\"\n\"I deal\" sounds like \"ideal\" and fits with the banker clue, as a dealer or someone who deals cards or money.\n\"Ideal\" is 5 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: IDEAL",
    "65": "'carp' can mean complain, nag.\n'shrew' can also mean nag, scold.\nThe common synonym for both 'carp' and 'shrew' when considering their verbal meanings is nag.\n'nag' is 3 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: NAG",

    "70": "'Reasonable' can mean fair, logical, sensible.\n'food allowance' could be a reference to ration, diet.\n'for Capone' might indicate something related to Al Capone, a famous gangster, possibly a play on words or a nickname.\nCombining 'reasonable' and 'food allowance,' we might look for a term that fits both.\n\nThe term 'fair' can mean reasonable and 'ration' means food allowance.\nPutting these together, we can think of 'fair ration' but that doesn't fit the character count or make a real word.\n\nLet's think about Al Capone and his era, the Prohibition era, and what might be associated with that. Al Capone was known for bootlegging, which includes the illegal distribution of alcohol.\n'Fair' as in a 'fair deal' or 'fair share' might be a stretch, but it could be a reasonable interpretation for a food allowance or distribution.\n\nRecalling that Capone was involved in the illegal alcohol trade, we can consider if there's a term that fits both the idea of a 'reasonable food allowance' and something Capone might deal with. 'Fair play' or 'fair game' don't quite fit the food allowance concept.\n\nWe need to find a term that combines the idea of reasonable, food allowance, and potentially something related to Capone or his activities. A term like 'fair play' doesn't quite fit, but let's consider synonyms or related terms.\nA 'square meal' is a term that means a substantial, satisfying, and balanced meal, which fits with 'reasonable food allowance.' It also has an old-fashioned tone that might align with the era of Al Capone.\n\n'Square meal' fits the character count of 8 and combines the idea of a reasonable (fair, balanced) food allowance.\nAnswer: SQUARE MEAL",

    "77": "'Is he civil Ian? Clot!' seems to be an anagram indicator.\n'He's hiding non-military attire!' suggests that the answer is related to civilian or non-military clothing.\n\nBreaking down the phrase 'Is he civil Ian? Clot!' and rearranging the letters:\n- Anagramming 'Is he civil Ian? Clot!' can give us multiple combinations, but we need to focus on those related to non-military attire.\n\nThe phrase 'Is he civil Ian? Clot!' contains 15 letters, matching the requirement.\n- Anagramming this phrase, we find the words 'civilian clothes,' which is a term for non-military attire.\n\nAnswer: CIVILIAN CLOTHES",

    "83": "'Keep watchful eye' can mean monitor, observe, guard.\n'on computer screen' can mean display, monitor.\n'Keep watchful eye on' is likely a definition hinting at a synonym.\nThe word 'monitor' fits both 'keep watchful eye' and 'on computer screen'.\nMonitor is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: MONITOR",

Let's consider embedding or a hidden element.\nLooking at South American countries, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, etc., none start with 'spy' and R.\n\nLet's think about another interpretation:\n- 'Agent' could be a synonym for something else.\n- 'First rights' could mean the first letter 'R'.\n- 'in a South American country' might mean the letter R is inside the name of a country.\n\nConsidering this, let\u2019s try:\n- 'Agent' = Rep (short for representative)\n- 'first rights' = R\n- 'in a South America country' = Argentina\n\nPutting R inside Argentina could be rearranged to form Argentina but with R at the beginning, it still doesn\u2019t fit.

    "95": "'Her nail broke' suggests an anagram, as indicated by the word 'broke'.\n'healthier puffer' suggests looking for a word related to a healthier option for a smoker or inhaler.\nBreaking down 'her nail' into an anagram can give us several combinations.\n'healthier' can mean fitter, better.\n'puffer' can mean inhaler, which is often used by individuals with respiratory issues.\n\nTrying the anagram of 'her nail' - we can create several combinations, but we need to fit it into the context of a 'healthier puffer'.\n'Inhaler' fits the definition of a 'healthier puffer' and can be formed by rearranging the letters in 'her nail'.\n\nInhaler is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: INHALER",

Alternatively, we could consider synonyms or related terms to 'fiddles' that fit with 'V' as a starting or ending letter.\n\nOne possibility:\n- 'Violins' are often associated with the verb 'fiddles' as both a noun and a verb (to play the violin).\n- The word 'violins' starts with 'V', aligning with 'vision's' letterhead.\n\nThus, the answer that fits the clue and the length (7 letters) is:\nAnswer: VIOLINS",
    "97": "'Writes' can mean pens, scribes, authors.\n'about' can mean re, on, concerning.\n'creep' can mean sneak, crawl, slink.\n'on board ship' can mean SS (abbreviation for steamship) or aboard.\n'about' might also be a wordplay indicator for enclosing or surrounding.\n\nConsidering 'Writes about creep on board ship', we can think:\n1. 'Writes' could be 'pens' or 'authors'.\n2. 'about' as a wordplay indicator could suggest surrounding or enclosing.\n3. 'creep' could be 'slink'.\n4. 'on board ship' could suggest including 'SS'.\n\nPutting these together:\n- If we take 'slink' as 'creep', and surround it by 'SS' (indicating 'on board ship'), we get 'SS' + 'slink' + 'SS'.\n- This doesn't make a sensible word, so we need to reconsider the arrangement.\n- Instead, enclose 'slink' with 'pens' (from 'Writes'), which doesn't quite work either.\n- Let's try another approach: 'Writes' is 'pens', 'creep' is 'slink', and 'about' is the enclosure. We need to fit 'SS' around or within these elements.\n\nThe correct arrangement:\n- 'pens' about 'slink' with 'SS' doesn\u2019t seem to work directly, but let's consider 'slink' surrounded by 'SS' and then think about 'pens' or a synonym of it.\n- 'SS' + 'slink' + 'SS' still doesn't work, but we could consider synonyms for 'Writes' that fit the pattern or reevaluate 'creep'.\n\nRevising the approach:\n- 'Writes' can also mean 'records' or 'logs'.\n- 'creep' can be 'sneak'.\n- 'about' can still be the indicator for enclosure.\n- 'on board ship' is still likely 'SS'.\n\nSolution:\n- 'SS' + 'logs' + 'SS' doesn't work, but 'logs' itself might be the wrong track.\n- 'Writes' as 'scripts' and 'creep' as 'sneak' with 'about' still as the enclosure:\n- Enclose 'sneak' with 'SS' = 'SS' + 'sneak' + 'SS' = 'SSsneakSS' doesn't work.\n- Reassessing the elements, 'pens' (writes) about 'sneak' (creep) on board 'SS' (ship) = 'SS' + 'pens' + 'sneak' = still not fitting.\n\nFinal attempt:\n- 'Writes' about 'creep' on board 'SS':\n- 'Writes' as 'scripts' and 'creep' as 'sneak' with 'about' as the enclosure:\n- 'SS' + 'sneak' + 'SS' = 'SSsneakSS' is incorrect.\n- Looking for synonyms of 'Writes' that fit the pattern, consider 'scripts', 'records', 'logs', 'composes'.\n- 'Composes' about 'sneak' on board 'SS' = 'SS' + 'composes' + 'sneak' = still not right.\n\nCorrect Answer: SCRIBES\n- 'Writes' = 'scribes'\n- 'about' = 're'\n- 'creep' = 'creep'\n- 'on board ship' = 'SS'\n- 'Scribes' about 'creep' on board 'SS' = 'SS' + 'creep' + 're' = 'SCREE' + 're' = 'SCREES', but this is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer, considering the clue structure and possible wordplay, might be simpler than initially thought.

    "101": "'tampered with' can mean altered, manipulated, distorted.\n'long title' can suggest a lengthy designation or name.\n'illegally obtained' can suggest stolen, smuggled, pirated.\n\nGiven the clue structure, 'tampered with' might be used as an anagram indicator.\n'long title' could be the letters that need to be rearranged.\nHowever, the phrase 'long title' itself might not provide clear letters for rearrangement, so we need to think of synonyms.\n\nLet's consider:\n- 'long title' could be synonymous with something like 'epithet' (a descriptive title or name).\n- 'tampered with' as an anagram indicator suggests rearranging 'epithet'.\n- However, 'epithet' is only 7 letters, so we may need to adjust our approach.\n\nIf we consider 'long title' as 'epithet' and add 'illegally obtained' as 'hot' (slang for stolen goods), we could form an anagram:\n- Anagramming 'epithet' with 'hot' gives us 'epithet' + 'hot' = 'epithethot'.\n- This doesn't form a meaningful word, so let's reevaluate.\n\nLet's try another synonym for 'long title':\n- 'caption' could be another synonym for 'title'.\n- Adding 'hot' for 'illegally obtained' gives us 'captionhot'.\n- Anagramming 'captionhot' might yield a meaningful word.\n\nRe-anagramming:\n- 'captionhot' rearranged can form 'hotcaption'.\n- This still does not yield a meaningful word.\n\nConsidering another approach:\n- 'long title' can also mean 'caption'.\n- 'illegally obtained' as 'hot'.\n- 'tampered with' suggests manipulating these words.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the synonyms and indicators:\n- 'caption' (long title) + 'hot' (illegally obtained) gives 'hotcaption'.\n- Anagramming 'hotcaption' to find a meaningful 9-letter word.\n\nFinally, the correct anagram:\n- 'hotcaption' anagrammed correctly is 'POTHECATE', which means to pawn or mortgage \u2013 aligning with the idea of 'illegally obtained'.\n\nAnswer: POTHECATE",
    "102": "'Advance' can mean move forward, progress, loan.\n'experience' can suggest undergo, encounter, feel.\n'for' might be a linking word or part of the wordplay.\n'estate conversion' suggests a transformation or change related to property, or it might be an anagram indicator.\n\nConsidering 'estate conversion' as an anagram indicator:\nThe phrase 'estate conversion' suggests an anagram of 'estate' plus a word for 'experience'.\nAn anagram of 'estate' is 'setate'.\n\nCombining 'setate' with a synonym for 'experience', such as 'test' (which means to undergo or experience), we get 'setatetest'.\n\nHowever, rearranging 'estate' and adding a word related to 'experience' might be more straightforward:\nAn anagram of 'estate' is 'setate'. Adding 'test' for 'experience', we get 'setatetest', but it doesn't fit the character count or make a sensible word.\n\nLet's reevaluate:\n'Advance' as 'fore' (meaning ahead, in advance).\n'experience' as 'test' (to experience or undergo).\n'for estate conversion' suggests an anagram of 'estate' around 'test'.\n\nCombining 'fore' with an anagram of 'estate' around 'test' doesn't quite work either.\n\nLet's think of another approach:\n'Advance' as 'fore'.\n'experience' as 'test'.\n'for estate conversion' might suggest a more straightforward solution, not necessarily involving an anagram.\n\nCombining 'fore' and 'test' we get 'foretest', but that's not correct.\n\nConsidering synonyms and wordplay:\n'Advance' could also mean 'progress'.\n'experience' as 'test'.\n'for estate conversion' might not necessarily be an anagram but a transformation.\n\nThe answer 'forefront' (9 letters) could be considered if 'fore' is taken as 'advance' and 'front' as a leading or primary position (akin to 'experience' or 'estate' leading or prominent feature), but it doesn't perfectly fit the clue.\n\nLet's simplify:\n'Advance' as 'progress'.\n'experience' as 'test'.\nCombining these ideas, we get 'protest' (to object or express disapproval, which can be a form of taking a stance or advancing a position).\n\nFinal Answer: PROTEST (9 letters) - This fits as 'pro' can mean 'for' and 'test' as 'experience', and together 'protest' can be seen as a form of 'advance experience'.",
    "103": "'The Press' can mean media, newspapers, or journalists.\n'leaves' can mean exits, departs, or foliage.\n'presenters' can mean hosts, speakers, or emcees.\n'to go in' can mean enter or insert.\n'leaves' might be a wordplay indicator suggesting removal.\nIf we consider 'The Press' as 'media' and remove a synonym for 'leaves' such as 'go' from 'media', we are left with 'medi'.\nAdding 'a' to complete the wordplay, we get 'media'.\n'media' is a synonym for 'The Press'.\n'media' is 5 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: MEDIA",
    "104": "'design theme' could be referring to motif or pattern.\n'moat, if used soundly' suggests a homophone clue.\nWe need to find a word that sounds like a combination of 'moat' and 'if'.\n'Motif' sounds like 'moat' and 'if' combined.\nMotif is a design or theme.\nMotif is 5 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: MOTIF",

    "106": "'Hangs around' can mean loiters, lingers, stays.\n'for the end of' is probably a wordplay indicator suggesting we should look at the end of a word.\n'exploiters' can mean users, abusers, manipulators.\nTaking the end of 'exploiters' gives us 's'.\n'Hangs around' with 's' might indicate a word ending with 's'.\nLoiters, lingers, and stays do not fit the pattern.\nReconsidering 'Hangs around' - another synonym could be 'dangles'.\n'Dangles' ends with 's' and fits the pattern of hanging or suspending.\n'Dangles' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: DANGLES",
    "107": "'Call out' can mean shout, expose, decry.\n'former' can mean ex, old, past.\n'allegation' can mean claim, accusation, charge.\n'former allegation' can be interpreted as an 'ex-claim'.\n'ex-claim' sounds like 'exclaim', which means 'call out'.\n'exclaim' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: EXCLAIM",
    "108": "'Uses resources' can mean taps, utilizes, expends.\n'sketch' can mean draw, outline, trace.\n'offspring' can mean child, kid, progeny.\n'Uses resources to sketch offspring' could be interpreted as utilizing resources to create an outline or drawing of a child.\nBreaking it down:\n- 'Uses resources' could be a synonym for 'draws' meaning to use up or deplete.\n- 'to sketch' could be reinforcing the idea of drawing.\n- 'offspring' could be 'son'.\nCombining 'draws' with 'son' gives us 'drawson', but it doesn't fit or make sense.\nLet's consider:\n- 'draw' as a synonym for 'uses resources' (like drawing on resources).\n- 'son' as 'offspring'.\n- Putting these together in a more cryptic way, we could consider a term that means both using resources and relating to offspring.\n'Drawson' doesn't work, but let's think of a word that encapsulates both concepts in a broader sense.\n'Draws on' could be seen as using resources and 'son' is directly offspring.\nHowever, no clear single word fits perfectly. Let's consider synonyms or related words:\n- 'Depends' could be a synonym for 'uses resources' (as in depending on resources).\n- 'Son' is straightforward.\n'Depends' doesn't fit with 'son' directly, but if we think of a word meaning both using resources and related to offspring, 'Depends' could suggest dependency which is a characteristic of offspring on parents.\nHowever, 'depends' is only 7 characters and fits the character count.\nAnswer: DEPENDS",
    "109": "'Overnight stay' can mean sleep, rest, stopover.\n'at repairs bay' suggests a location or a setting.\n'Mine's best!' could imply a possessive or superlative form.\nLet's consider 'Overnight stay at repairs bay' as a phrase where 'repairs bay' could be an anagram indicator.\nThe phrase 'repairs bay' doesn't directly suggest an anagram, but let's consider the words around it. 'At' could suggest a location or a setting.\nLooking at the word 'repairs,' it can be reorganized to form 'aspirer', which doesn\u2019t fit. However, let's see if the phrase 'repairs bay' can be reorganized into a 7-letter word.\n'Repairs bay' minus 'at' doesn\u2019t directly suggest a useful anagram. Let\u2019s rethink the clue:\n'Overnight stay' could also mean a short stay like 'B&B' (bed and breakfast).\nIf 'Mine's best!' is emphasizing a superlative or a possessive, it could mean 'top' or 'peak'.\nCombining 'B&B' with 'top' or 'peak' doesn\u2019t form a recognized word.\nLet's look at synonyms of 'Overnight stay' - 'sojourn' fits the character count and could imply a short or temporary stay.\n'Sojourn' is a 7-letter word fitting the character count.\nAnswer: SOJOURN",
    "110": "'Road sign' can mean stop, yield, or any specific traffic directive.\n'requesting donation' can involve terms like ask, give, fund.\n'custom' can mean habit, tradition, practice.\nThe phrase 'requesting donation of custom' could be a play on words.\nA common road sign that also suggests a 'custom' or habitual action is \"YIELD.\"\n'Yield' in another sense can mean 'give' as in giving way or giving up something.\nThis fits with the idea of 'requesting donation' (giving up something customary).\nYIELD is 5 characters, so we need to consider the full answer.\nThe full answer needs to incorporate 'road sign' and 'requesting donation of custom'.\n'YIELD' could be part of a larger phrase or concept fitting the clue.\nHowever, it seems we need a 7-letter word, so we need to think of another road sign or a different interpretation.\n'YIELD' might be the concept but not the exact answer.\nLet's consider 'GIVEWAY', which is another form of 'Yield' and is used in some countries.\n'GIVEWAY' is a road sign and fits the idea of 'requesting donation of custom' as it asks drivers to give way to others, a form of donating their right of passage.\nGIVEWAY is 7 characters and fits the character count.\nAnswer: GIVEWAY",
    "111": "'Tow item' can mean rope, chain, cable.\n'around' is often used as an indicator for a container or reversal in cryptic crosswords.\n'to be unfaithful' can mean cheat, betray.\n'lover' can mean beau, dear, flame.\n\nLet's consider how these might fit together:\n- 'tow item' like rope or cable could be wrapped around something.\n- 'to be unfaithful to lover' could be encapsulated in the term \"betray.\"\n\nIf we use 'cable' as the 'tow item' and think of a word that could mean both 'to be unfaithful' and involve 'lover', we need a 7-letter word. \n\nConsidering 'around' as a container indicator, we can look for a word where 'cable' or another tow item is wrapped around a synonym for 'to be unfaithful' or vice versa:\n- Betrayal is too long, and cheat doesn't fit with the letters in 'cable.'\n\nA possible fit:\n- \"Cable\" wrapped around \"heart\" (a poetic term for lover) doesn't work.\n- Reversing the idea, a word that encapsulates 'cable' in terms of betrayal and love, but formatted differently.\n\nLet's reconsider:\n- \"Cable\" doesn't necessarily have to be the exact letters; it could be a synonym or related word.\n- \"Rope\" is another common tow item. \n\nIf we wrap \"rope\" around a synonym for betrayal or unfaithful:\n- Betray doesn't fit, but if we consider an indirect approach with 'rope' and 'lover', we might think of a scenario or a word where a rope is used metaphorically in a relationship.\n\nThe answer could be \"ENTRAP\" where:\n- \"EN\" and \"RAP\" can be seen as wrapping around, and \"entrap\" itself means to deceitfully cause someone to be in a situation, akin to being unfaithful.\n\nHowever, this doesn't perfectly fit the 'lover' unless interpreted very loosely. Let's try another approach:\n- \"Cheat\" as being unfaithful, and \"rope\" to tow.\n\nCombining these:\n- \"CHEATER\" where 'cheat' is to be unfaithful, and 'er' could be a poetic suffix or abbreviation, but it doesn't use 'rope.' \n\nThis is tricky without a perfect match. Let's try a simpler approach:\n- Consider synonyms for 'tow item' and 'to be unfaithful' that fit together in a 7-letter word. \n\nRevisiting the idea:\n- \"TRAILER\" where 'trail' can be seen as a form of following (akin to towing), and 'er' (a common suffix or could imply a person involved in an action).\n\nThis still isn't perfect, so the best guess remains a bit of a stretch:\n- \"TRAILER\" with a loose interpretation or another unknown synonym fitting the pattern.\n\nFinal answer (with reservations): TRAILER",
    "112": "'Green' can mean inexperienced, fresh, eco-friendly, naive.\n'girl' can be a female name or a generic term like lady or girl.\n'I love' can be interpreted as 'I' and 'love', where 'love' in tennis means zero.\n'to pieces' is likely a wordplay indicator suggesting an anagram or breaking down.\n\nCombining these ideas:\n'girl' might be represented by 'Olive' which is also a name and a type of green.\n'I love' can be interpreted as 'I' and 'O' (love in tennis).\nIf we consider 'Olive' and rearrange 'I' and 'O' into it, it doesn\u2019t change as 'Olive' already contains 'I' and 'O'.\n\n'Olive' is a synonym for a type of green.\n'Olive' fits the character count of 5.\nAnswer: OLIVE",

Let's reconsider:\n- 'thumb' and 'proceeded awkwardly' might suggest a larger anagram.\n- An anagram of 'thumb' without any letters removed and including an indicator of movement or progression could be 'humble' (as in 'humbled' without the 'd').\n\nThe clue seems complex, so let's simplify:\n- 'Cockney claimed he lost blood from thumb' could also be interpreted as a phrase where 'blood' (as a term of endearment or familial relation in Cockney slang) is removed from a phrase involving 'thumb'.\n- 'Proceeded awkwardly' could still suggest an anagram.\n\nLet's think of a different approach:\n- 'Cockney claimed' might suggest a homophone clue where the word sounds like another without the initial 'h'.\n- 'he lost blood from thumb' could be a misleading phrase.\n\nConsidering all possibilities:\n- 'Cockney claimed' might suggest 'eard' (sounded like 'heard').\n- 'he lost blood from thumb' might not need to focus on the literal meaning but more on the sound or a misleading interpretation.\n\nIf we think of 'eard' and 'thumb' together, it's not leading to a clear answer. Let's try another interpretation:\n- If 'thumb' is metaphorically used for something small or a part of something, and 'blood' is removed, we might need to focus on the essence or core idea it represents.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try a simpler solution:\n- 'Cockney claimed' suggests a homophone.\n- 'he lost blood from thumb' suggests removing a central or key part (like the 'blood' or core).\n\nLet's try:\n- Homophone for a word sounding like 'claimed' but without 'h' could be 'aimed'.\n- Removing the 'core' from 'thumb', we focus on 'thumb' itself but without its essence.\n\nThe answer, considering the homophone and the removal of a core component, might still be elusive without more context or a clearer direction from the clue. This one might need a reevaluation or more context to solve accurately.",

    "123": "'damp oar' seems like an anagram indicator, where the letters need to be rearranged.\n'could become' also suggests an anagram.\nLooking at 'damp oar', rearranging the letters, we can find a word related to a navigator's tool.\nRearranging 'damp oar', we get 'adormap', 'roadmap', 'parmoda', etc.\n'roadmap' fits as it is a tool used for navigation.\n'roadmap' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: ROADMAP",

'sub' reversed could be 'bus'.\n2. 'in rough sea' - an anagram of 'sea' is 'aes'.\n\nNow combining 'bus' with 'aes' doesn't seem to make a valid word. Let's think of another interpretation:\n- 'sub' reversed as 'bus' and then think of a term for 'rough sea' that could fit around 'bus'. \n\n'Rough sea' could be described as 'surge' or 'swell'. Inserting 'bus' into a synonym of 'sea' or combining it with an anagram doesn't seem to work. Let's reconsider the 'sub' and 'rough sea' elements:\n- 'sub' reversed as 'bus' and looking for a word related to 'rough sea' that can incorporate 'bus' to form a new word.\n\nA common crossword strategy is to fit one part into another. If we think of 'sub' as 'sub' itself and consider it reversed or manipulated into a synonym for 'rough sea', we might consider 'abuses'. Here, 'sub' reversed is still 'bus', and if we think of 'uses' as a synonym for employs or utilizes, it might fit into a context of 'abuses' where 'sub' is embedded into a larger word.\n\nThus, 'abuses' fits the clue:\n- 'Uses foul language' = abuses\n- 'sub' reversed within a word related to rough handling or negative usage = abuses.\n- It fits the character count of 6.\n\nAnswer: ABUSES",

    "144": "'showing great dignity' can mean majestic, noble, august.\n'am back' suggests a reversal of 'ma'.\n'in charge of' can mean IC (short for \"in charge\").\n'inside' suggests that a word or letters are to be placed within another.\n'joke' can mean gag, jest.\n\nPutting it together:\n'am back' reversed is 'ma'.\n'in charge of' abbreviated is 'IC'.\n'inside joke' suggests placing 'IC' inside 'gag', forming 'gagIC'.\nThen adding the reversed 'am' ('ma') at the end gives us 'gagICma'.\n\nHowever, this doesn't form a meaningful word or fit the clue directly. We need to rethink:\n'joke' can mean 'gag'.\n'inside gag' with 'ma' reversed ('am') and 'IC' could lead to 'ma' + 'gag' + 'IC' = 'magagic', which still doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's consider:\n'joke' can mean 'jest'.\n'inside jest' with 'ma' reversed ('am') and 'IC' could lead to 'majestic' if we consider 'jest' containing 'IC' and 'am' reversed at the start:\n'ma' + 'jest' with 'IC' inside = 'majestIC' which is 'majestic'.\n\n'majestic' means 'showing great dignity'.\n'majestic' is 8 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: MAJESTIC",

Here, 'macabre storyteller' suggests a specific type of storyteller associated with grim or eerie tales. Edgar Allan Poe is a famous macabre storyteller.\n\n'to attempt' indicates an action, and 'verse' suggests a poetic form. \n\nCombining these ideas:\n- Poe (macabre storyteller)\n- Try (to attempt)\n- Verse (poem)\n\nPutting 'Poe' together with 'try' gives us 'Poetry', which is a form of verse.\n\n'Poetry' fits the definition of 'verse' and the character count of 6.\nAnswer: POETRY",

'Solitaire' is too long.\nThe answer that fits both the clue's playfulness and the character count is 'Euchre', which is a 6-letter card game, but we need 7 letters.\nRevisiting the clue, if we interpret 'Would you' as 'would you consider', it could lead to 'Would you consider playing this card game?'.\nThus, the answer, fitting the playful interpretation and the 7-letter requirement, might be 'Hearts', as in 'Would you (ask if Daisy could) heart(s)?', playing on the affectionate connotation of 'Daisy' and 'hearts' in the card game.\nAnswer: HEARTS",

    "161": "'dentist's tool' might refer to specific equipment used by a dentist.\n'used to be' can suggest a past tense or a previous function, and might be a wordplay indicator.\n'a farm vehicle' could refer to tractor, plow, harvester, etc.\nCombining these ideas, we need to think of a dentist's tool that sounds like or is related to a farm vehicle.\n'extractor' fits as a dentist's tool (used for pulling teeth).\n'extractor' sounds similar to 'tractor', which is a farm vehicle.\n'extractor' is 9 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: EXTRACTOR",
    "162": "'stingy' can mean miserly, tight, cheap.\n'Mac' could refer to a person or a shortened form of a name like \"Macintosh.\"\n'could be quite acrobatic' suggests a wordplay involving an anagram.\nThe word 'stingy' along with 'Mac' gives us the letters to work with.\nAn anagram of 'stingymac' is gymnastic.\n'Gymnastic' relates to being acrobatic.\n'Gymnastic' is 9 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: GYMNASTIC",
    "163": "'Systems of beliefs' can mean creeds, faiths, dogmas.\n'of a pooch' suggests a play on words involving dogs.\n'Mum' might be an indicator to use a synonym or an abbreviation related to mother, or it could be instructing silence or a hidden word.\n'Mum' could also be a homophone indicator, suggesting a sound-alike word.\nCombining 'dog' (pooch) with a sound-alike or synonym of 'mum' could lead to 'dogma'.\n'dogma' means a system of beliefs.\n'dogma' is 5 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: DOGMA",

We need a word that starts with 'is' and conveys a formal gesture.\n'Isalute' does not exist.\nConsidering 'salute' alone, if we reverse 'yes' as 'si' to 'is' and try to find a gesture that might fit with 'is', we could think about 'isnod' or 'isbow', but these are not correct.\nLet's try reversing 'nod' to get 'don'. Then, if 'yes' is 'si' and reversed as 'is', we combine to get 'isnod' or 'nodis', which are incorrect.\nRevisiting the clue, we might have misunderstood the components. Let's consider 'yes, return' as 'aye' reversed to 'eya' and 'abrupt formal gesture' as a single word. We need a 7-letter word for an abrupt formal gesture.\nA correct answer might be 'salute', but it does not fit with the reversal or the components.\nThe answer could be 'nodsyes', but it's not a valid word.\nWe need to find a valid 7-letter word that fits all parts of the clue.\nThe correct answer might be 'salutes' if we interpret 'yes, return' and 'abrupt' differently, where 'yes' is 'si', reversed to 'is', and 'abrupt' is interpreted as 'sudden', leading to a quick 'salute', thus forming 'salutes'.",

Let's revisit:\n- 'head' as in 'top'.\n- 'torn' as in 'rent'.\n- Applying a Spoonerism, we get 'tent rop'.\n\nFinally, if we consider 'spirits' in a literal sense (ghosts):\n- 'head' as in 'top' and 'torn' as in 'rent'.\n- Spoonerism might be 'tent rop' or 'rent top'.\n- 'occupied by' suggests something inside, like 'gin'.\n\nIf we consider 'rent top' and swap it to 'tent rop', and think of 'rop' as a mispronunciation of 'rope' (a stretch in interpretation), it still doesn't fit perfectly.\n\nThis clue remains challenging without more context or a clearer hint from the clue. The best guess remains speculative without additional hints or a clearer Spoonerism. More information or a reevaluation of the clue's structure might be necessary to solve this accurately.",
    "194": "'Non-professional' can mean amateur, casual, lay.\n'made tea' could mean brewed, but here it might be an anagram indicator.\n'a rum mixture' suggests an anagram using the letters in 'a rum'.\nIf we consider 'amateur' as 'non-professional', we can check if it fits with the anagram.\nUsing the letters from 'a rum' and rearranging them doesn't fit directly into 'amateur', but let's consider the full phrase 'made tea - a rum'.\nAnagramming 'made tea - a rum' can give us 'amateur', fitting the definition of non-professional.\n'amateur' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: AMATEUR",
    "195": "'Listen' can mean hear or hark.\n'was banned' can suggest a wordplay on prohibition or exclusion.\n'Anna' might be a part of the wordplay or direct clue.\n'large handkerchief' can be a bandana.\nThe word 'bandana' includes 'Anna' at the end.\n'Listen' might be a homophone indicator or just an attention grabber.\n'band' (as in bandana) could be linked with 'banned' as a homophone.\n'bandana' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: BANDANA",
    "196": "'To twice' indicates doing something two times, and could be a play on words.\n'Dorothy's dog' from The Wizard of Oz is named Toto.\n'To twice' could be indicating the repetition of the name Toto.\nToto repeated twice fits the clue 'To twice find Dorothy's dog'.\nToto is 4 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: TOTO",
    "197": "'Change left to right' suggests replacing the letter 'L' with 'R'.\n'filth' can mean dirt, muck, grime.\n'narrow Scottish inlet' refers to a specific geographical term, which is 'firth'.\nIf we change 'left' to 'right' in the word 'firth' (although it doesn't directly apply here), we look for a synonym of 'filth' that fits this pattern.\nSince 'firth' doesn't contain 'L', we look for synonyms of 'filth' that fit the clue and length.\nOne synonym for 'filth' that fits the scenario of a narrow Scottish inlet and is 5 letters long is 'firth'.\nAnswer: FIRTH",
    "198": "'Sound' can mean noise, tone, echo.\n'returning' is often a wordplay indicator for reversal (especially in down clues).\n'from within' suggests taking letters from inside another word.\n'the choir' gives us the letters to work with.\n\nLet's consider the wordplay:\n- 'Sound' suggests we are looking for a word related to sounds or hearing.\n- 'returning from within the choir' suggests looking inside 'choir' for a word that can be reversed to fit the definition of 'sound'.\n\nLooking inside 'choir' and considering reversals:\n- 'choir' reversed is 'riohc'.\n- Extracting a relevant sound-related word from these letters doesn't directly yield a known word. We might need to think about synonyms for choir or parts of it.\n\nConsidering 'echo' as a possibility:\n- 'Echo' is a sound and fits the definition.\n- If we take 'chor' from 'choir' and reverse it, we get 'rohc', which doesn't work. But focusing solely on 'echo' as a sound and its relevance to the clue:\n  - 'Echo' is a sound that returns or repeats, fitting the clue of \"Sound returning.\"\n\nAnswer: ECHO",
    "199": "'Rio missions came unstuck' suggests an anagram as indicated by 'came unstuck.'\n'because of hotel' suggests the inclusion of the letter 'H' (using the NATO phonetic alphabet where 'Hotel' stands for 'H').\n'doormen' might be the definition part of the clue.\n\nAnagramming 'Rio missions came' with 'H' included gives us the phrase 'commissionaires.'\n'commissionaires' are indeed hotel doormen.\n'commissionaires' is 15 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: COMMISSIONAIRES",
    "200": "'Give dignity to' can mean honor, ennoble, elevate.\n'the bone' could be a specific bone like femur, tibia, or a general term.\n'Len broke' is probably a wordplay indicator referring to anagrams.\n'enoble' is an anagram of 'bone Len'.\n'enoble' is a synonym of 'give dignity to'.\n'enoble' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: ENNOBLE",
    "201": "'Hum' can mean to sing softly, murmur, drone.\n'first bars' suggests taking the initial letters of something.\n'Led to be humiliated' might be a definition or further wordplay.\nConsidering 'first bars' and the phrase 'Led to be humiliated', it could be a pun or a homophone.\n\nBreaking down the phrase:\n- 'Hum first bars' could mean to take the initial letters of 'Led to be humiliated'. However, this doesn't seem to give a clear answer.\n- Alternatively, 'Led to be humiliated' might be describing the action of being led somewhere and then humiliated, suggesting a phrase or word related to 'humiliation' or 'embarrassment'.\n\nLet's consider the entire clue as a cryptic definition:\n- The phrase 'Hum first bars? Led to be humiliated!' might be a playful way of describing a situation where someone is led (possibly misled) by the initial sounds (or 'bars' in music) of something, resulting in a humiliating outcome.\n\nReevaluating the clue and focusing on the wordplay of 'hum' and 'bars':\n- 'Hum' and 'first bars' might imply the initial sound or part of a word related to 'humiliation' or 'embarrassment'.\n\nThe best fit for the clue, considering the wordplay and definition:\n- 'ABASHED' fits the definition of being humiliated and the wordplay isn't directly clear, but it can be interpreted as a cryptic definition where the answer itself is derived from the overall meaning of the clue rather than direct manipulation of letters.\n- 'ABASHED' is 7 characters and fits the character count.\n\nAnswer: ABASHED",
    "202": "'diplomatic' can mean tactful, polite, suave.\n'to remove' can be a wordplay indicator suggesting elimination or subtraction.\n'facial twitch' can mean tic.\n'for' can be a linking word or imply substitution.\n'academic qualification' can mean degree, diploma.\n\nCombining these, if we consider 'diplomatic' as 'tactful' and 'facial twitch' as 'tic', and 'to remove' suggests removing 'tic' from 'tactful', we get 'tactful' minus 'tic' which leaves 'tact'.\nHowever, 'tact' does not fit the character count (7).\n\nLet's reconsider:\nLooking at the phrase \"to remove facial twitch,\" we interpret 'facial twitch' as 'tic', and removing it from a word.\nIf we consider 'diplomatic' itself as the word from which to remove 'tic', we don\u2019t get a valid word. We need a 7-letter result.\n\nLet's think about synonyms for 'diplomatic' and 'academic qualification':\nA synonym for 'diplomatic' that includes 'tic' could be 'politic', and removing 'tic' from 'politic' results in 'poli'. This does not fit the character count or make sense.\n\nLet's reanalyze:\nIf 'diplomatic' is a synonym for the entire answer, and we focus on 'remove facial twitch for academic qualification', we might be looking for a word that is a type of 'academic qualification' minus the letters in 'tic'. \nA common 'academic qualification' is 'diploma'. Removing 'tic' from 'diploma' doesn\u2019t fit. \n\nWe need a 7-letter word:\nConsidering 'diplomatic' as a hint towards the nature of the answer, and 'academic qualification' as 'degree', adding 'tic' (facial twitch) to 'degree' gives us 'degreetic', which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\nIf 'diplomatic' means 'tactful' and we need to find a 7-letter word for 'academic qualification' that might include removing or adding 'tic', consider 'diplomat' (a similar word to 'diplomatic') and 'tic'. If we add 'tic' to 'degree', we get 'degreetic', which is incorrect.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits 'diplomatic to remove facial twitch for academic qualification' where the facial twitch (tic) is removed from a word related to 'diplomatic' resulting in a term for 'academic qualification'. \n\nFinally, if we consider 'diplomat' as a form of 'diplomatic', and remove 'tic' from an extended form, we could think of 'diplomatic' as 'diplomatics' (though not a standard word), remove 'tic', and we are left with 'diploma'. This fits the character count and the clue's requirements.\n\nAnswer: DIPLOMA",

Let's think of other possibilities.\n'Grip' is a synonym for 'hold tight' and has 4 characters.\nAdding 'O' at the beginning doesn't make sense, but if we consider \"at first\" as indicating the first letter of each word in \"View obstructed,\" we get 'V' and 'O'.\n'VO' + 'grip' = VOGrip still doesn't work; let's consider another synonym.\n'Clutch' is another word for 'hold tight' and has 6 characters.\nAdding 'O' at the beginning, we get 'Oclutch' which doesn't fit.\nLet's try another approach with another synonym.\n'Grasp' is also a synonym for 'hold tight' and has 5 characters.\nAdding 'O' at the beginning, we get 'Ograsp' which doesn't fit.\nWe need to rethink the approach or find a synonym that fits better.\n'Hold tight' can also suggest a strong hold or embrace. \n'Embrace' is 7 letters, fitting the character count, but doesn't use 'O'.\nLet's try 'Grapple' which means to hold tightly.\n'Grapple' fits the character count of 7 and aligns with the clue's demand for a synonym for 'hold tight'.\nAnswer: GRAPPLE",
    "228": "'Novelist' could refer to a specific writer or be used more generally.\n'and son' could indicate the addition of an 's' (common abbreviation for son).\n'not quite right' is likely a wordplay indicator suggesting a modification of a word, often removing the last letter.\nLet's consider famous novelist names that might fit with these hints.\n\nIf we consider 'novelist' as Austen (Jane Austen), and add 's' for 'son' we get Austens.\nThen, applying 'not quite right' by removing the last letter, we get Austen.\nAusten is 5 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: AUSTEN",
    "229": "'Promise' can mean vow, pledge, assure, swear.\n'to participate' can mean join, engage, enter.\nLooking at the clue structure, 'Promise to participate' could be a phrase where one word encapsulates both meanings.\n'engage' can mean both to promise (as in engage in a contract) and to participate (as in engage in an activity).\n'engage' is 6 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: ENGAGE",
    "230": "'Eastwood' can mean Clint Eastwood or simply a reference to a name or place.\n'entertains' can be a wordplay indicator suggesting containment or inclusion.\n'English' can be abbreviated as E.\n'customer' can mean client, buyer, shopper.\nThe clue structure suggests that 'Eastwood entertains' means a word containing 'E' for English.\nOne possible answer is 'client' where 'clint' (similar to Clint Eastwood) surrounds 'E' for English.\n'client' is a synonym for 'customer'.\n'client' is 6 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: CLIENT",
    "231": "'aviator' can mean pilot, flyer.\n'Brown' can be a surname or a color.\n'dual cockpit' suggests two or a pair.\n'Aviator with Brown' might imply a famous aviator associated with the name Brown.\n'Dual cockpit' might suggest a word that combines or involves two people.\nAmelia Earhart is a famous aviator but doesn't fit the clue.\nCharles Lindbergh is another famous aviator, but also doesn't fit.\nConsidering 'Brown' as a surname, we think of aviation pioneers or related terms.\n'Wright' could fit as the Wright brothers were pioneer aviators.\nThe word 'wright' also fits the character count of 6.\nAnswer: WRIGHT",
    "232": "'Flower' can mean bloom, but in cryptic clues, it can also be a homophone for 'flow-er' (something that flows).\n'shot up' can mean grown quickly, or in cryptic puzzles, it could mean reversed (as in reading upwards).\n'essayist' can refer to a famous essayist, such as Lamb (Charles Lamb).\n\nLet's analyze the wordplay:\n- 'shot up' suggests a reversal of something.\n- 'Flower' as a homophone for 'river' (something that flows).\n- 'seen by' suggests adjacency or next to.\n\nIf we look for a river and reverse it:\n- 'Lamb' is next to a reversed river name.\n- 'Ness' (as in Loch Ness) reversed is 'Ssen'.\n\nPutting 'Lamb' next to 'Ssen' reversed gives us 'Ness', which doesn't fit.\nLet\u2019s try another river:\n- 'Avon' (a famous river) reversed is 'Nova'.\n- 'Lamb' next to 'Nova' (Avon reversed) fits the pattern.\n\nThus, the answer using the clues and wordplay is:\nAnswer: NOVELLA (a short novel or long short story, and 'nova' (Avon reversed) seen by 'Lamb' (essayist Charles Lamb)).",
    "233": "'trained' can mean taught, coached, or it might be a wordplay indicator suggesting an anagram.\n'horses' is the word to potentially rearrange if 'trained' indicates an anagram.\nRearranging the letters of 'Nora's' gives us 'roans'.\n'Roans' are a type of horses with a mixed coloring of white and dark hairs.\n'Roans' fits the character count of 5.\nAnswer: ROANS",
    "234": "'Capital' can mean a city, money, or upper-case letter.\n'containing' is likely a wordplay indicator suggesting inclusion or enclosure.\n'a hospital' can refer to the letter 'H' which is commonly used to denote hospital.\n'for outcasts' can refer to a place or facility for those excluded or marginalized.\n\nGiven the word length of 6, we need to consider a capital (city or letter) containing 'a' and 'H'.\n'Pariah' fits the pattern, where 'Pari' can be interpreted as an abbreviation or a play on words for a capital, and 'aH' includes 'a' and 'H'.\n'Pariah' is a term for outcasts.\n'Pariah' is 6 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: PARIAH",
    "235": "'Illegal activity' can mean crime, theft, fraud, scam.\n'Central America' can mean the middle letters of the word \"America,\" which are \"eri.\"\n'disturbing' is a wordplay indicator suggesting an anagram.\n\nIf we consider 'crime' as 'illegal activity' and rearrange 'eri' (central letters of America), we can see that 'eri' is already in the correct order within the word 'crime.'\nThus, 'crime' fits both the definition of 'illegal activity' and incorporates 'Central America' (eri).\n'Crime' is 5 letters, matching the clue's requirement.\n\nAnswer: CRIME",
    "236": "'Current' can mean now, present, or a flow of electricity like amp.\n'form' can mean shape, structure, or type.\n'master' can mean expert, head, or a degree like MA.\n'for' is probably a linking word.\n\nIf we look at 'Current form for master?' and think about the word 'stream' \u2014\n'stream' can refer to a current of water (linking to 'current').\n'stream' can also refer to a class or level in school, which is a 'form'.\nAnd finally, 'stream' as a verb can mean to lead or excel, akin to a 'master'.\n\n'stream' is 6 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: STREAM",
    "237": "'drip' can mean to leak slowly, drop by drop.\n'means to be transformed' is probably a wordplay indicator referring to anagrams.\n'superhero' is what we are trying to find a synonym or related word for.\nSpiderman is an anagram of 'drip means'.\nSpiderman is a superhero.\nSpiderman is 9 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: SPIDERMAN",
    "238": "'Gallant' can mean brave, heroic, chivalrous.\n'in a hurry' can mean rushed, quick, fast.\nA synonym for 'gallant' that also implies speed could be related to knights or chivalry, as these are often associated with gallant behavior.\nCombining the idea of gallantry and speed, a word that fits is 'knightly'.\n'Knightly' describes someone who is gallant and the term can metaphorically suggest being in a hurry or swift in their actions.\n'Knightly' is 7 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: KNIGHTLY",
    "239": "'One living alone' can mean hermit, recluse.\n'before' can mean ahead, prior, or could be an indicator of placement in the answer.\n'being joined by' is likely a connector or combiner for word elements.\n'small child' can mean tot, kid.\n'hermit' followed by 'tot' (a synonym for small child) gives us 'hermittot'.\nHowever, combining these directly doesn't make a proper word. We should look for a smoother combination or a different interpretation.\nLet's try another approach: \"hermit\" being joined by \"tot\" can be combined as \"hermit\" + \"tot\" = \"hermitot\".\nThis combination still doesn't form a correct word. Let's think of a variant of \"hermit\" that might fit better.\nConsidering the character count of 7, \"hermit\" (6 letters) plus a short word for \"small child\" like \"tot\" (3 letters) exceeds the limit unless we modify \"hermit.\"\nWe can abbreviate \"hermit\" to \"herm\" and add \"tot,\" resulting in \"hermtot.\"\nThis still doesn't seem to work. Let's reconsider the elements:\nIf we consider \"recluse\" (another word for \"one living alone\") and try to join it with a shortened form of \"child,\" such as \"kid\":\n\"recluse\" + \"kid\" doesn't work due to the character count.\nLet's go back to \"hermit\":\nIf we consider \"hermit\" as the base and look for a three-letter word for \"small child\" that could fit:\n\"hermit\" + \"tot\" = \"hermitot\" still doesn't form a recognizable word.\nAnother possibility is to think of a different structure where \"hermit\" is modified or abbreviated in a way that fits with \"tot\" to make a 7-letter word.\nWe need to find a valid word that combines these ideas. Let's think of synonyms or related terms:\n\"hermit\" itself is 6 letters, so we need a very short word for \"small child\" to fit the total of 7 letters.\nReconsidering \"hermit\" and \"tot,\" we might be missing a simpler answer.\nThe correct answer might be \"hermit\" itself, considering that a \"hermit\" is indeed \"one living alone,\" and \"tot\" could be a playful addition or a red herring in this clue.\nTherefore, the answer might simply be HERMIT.",
    "240": "'Caress' can mean stroke, touch, pet.\n'member of boat crew' can mean rower, sailor, mate.\nCombining these, 'stroke' can mean both a gentle touch (caress) and a role in a rowing boat (member of boat crew).\n'stroke' is 6 characters and therefore fits the character count.\nAnswer: STROKE",
    "241": "'Professionals' can mean experts, skilled individuals, pros.\n'have it on toast' can be a literal or figurative phrase, possibly indicating something is easy or straightforward.\n'have' can mean own, possess.\n'on toast' could refer to something placed on toast, or figuratively, something easily handled or achieved.\n\nCombining these ideas:\n- 'Pros' is a short form for 'professionals'.\n- 'on toast' might be a playful way to indicate 'easily' or 'readily available'.\n- 'Pros' and 'on toast' together could suggest something professionals easily handle or excel at.\n\nHowever, focusing on a different angle:\n- 'Pros' could hint towards 'prosciutto', which is something that can literally be had on toast, fitting the playful nature of cryptic clues.\n\nSince 'prosciutto' is 9 letters and doesn't fit, let's reconsider:\n- Looking at simpler interpretations, 'pros' could hint towards 'prose', as in skilled writing (something professionals might metaphorically 'have on toast' due to their proficiency).\n\n'Prose' fits the character count and aligns with the clue:\nAnswer: PROSE",
    "242": "'Old' can mean ancient, former, or a prefix like 'ex-' indicating something past.\n'part of mansion' might refer to a specific section or feature of a mansion, such as a wing, hall, or annex.\n'is outstanding' can mean exceptional, prominent, or literally standing out.\nConsidering 'Old part of mansion', we might think of a specific old or notable part like 'wing'.\n'Wing' also means outstanding in the sense of extending outward.\n'Wing' is 4 characters, but we need a 5-character word.\nLet's consider 'ex-' as a prefix meaning old.\n'Ex' + 'wing' = 'exwing', which does not make sense.\nWe need to reconsider the wordplay or find another synonym.\nIf we think of 'outstanding' as protruding or prominent, another term could be 'gable' (as in a gable end of a roof, which stands out in many old mansions).\n'Gable' is 5 characters and fits the character count.\nAnswer: GABLE",
    "243": "'small fastener' can mean pin, clip, snap.\n'slow mover' can mean snail, tortoise, sloth.\nLooking at the words, 'pin' from 'small fastener' and 'snail' from 'slow mover' seem relevant.\nCombining 'pin' and 'snail' gives us 'snail', which fits the description of a slow mover.\nHowever, we need to find a word that is 5 characters long, which 'snail' is.\nTherefore, the answer that combines both 'small fastener' and 'slow mover' and fits the character count is 'SNAIL'."
